The included zip file is a unity project that implements Q-learning using temporal difference. It is created with Unity 2021.3.9f1, but should work fine with other versions. The scripts that implement Q-Learning are as follows:

"UnityProject\Assets\NewScripts\QLearningMain.cs"

- Calls the Q-learning function and sets up the mover.

"UnityProject\Assets\NewScripts\QLearningSolver.cs"

- Contains the functions for implementing Q-learning, getting the optimal policy, setting the reward and transition arrays, and other helper functions.

"UnityProject\Assets\NewScripts\Mover.cs"

- Moves the agent in the scene based on the optimal policy
